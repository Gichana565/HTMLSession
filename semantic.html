            <h1> What is the perks of being a Web Developer?</h1>
            <p>One of the most significant benefits of working in web development is the potential to earn a high salary; many Web Developers make $100,000 or more per year. Of course, when developers begin their careers, they earn a bit less—around $75,000 annually (which is almost $20,000 more than the average annual salary for all occupations in the United States.) After gaining several years of experience, the earning potential increases, allowing many developers to earn a six-figure salary.</p>
            <p>Another advantage to becoming a Web Developer is the job security that it offers. Web Developers are in high demand; according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 25,500 web development jobs will open up each year between now and 2030. That equals a growth rate of 13%, which is much higher than the 8% expected growth rate for all jobs. A growth rate like that means there will always be plenty of jobs available for Web Developers.</p>
            <p>A job in web development is also a great choice because the barrier to entry is relatively low. You don’t need a university degree to become a Web Developer; you can learn the necessary skills by completing a bootcamp, taking classes at a training school, or studying independently. While some employers may require a degree, the vast majority just want to see that you’re capable of doing the job.</p>
